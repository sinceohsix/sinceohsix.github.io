# @sinceohsix's Files
My files, look through them, you might find something cool. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### How does this work?  
Files are fetched from `manifest.json` and then loaded from the `contents/` directory. A previewer is built in and supports photo, text, and audio files currently.

### Can I make my own?
Yes! Fork this repository and simply replace the files and folders in the `contents/` folder with whatever you want in it! Make sure you update the `manifest.json` accordingly. You can also change the title in the `index.html` file and set your own icon.
